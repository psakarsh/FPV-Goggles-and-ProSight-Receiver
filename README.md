- The module needs to be oriented in the right way, i.e. The notch or marking facing the top.

  # How to Power up the Connex ProSight Receiver


- The Receiver can either be powered through a Lithium Polymer Battery (with Barrel jack breakout or a Wall Adapter)

###### NOTE - All slave displays will be receiving the cloned data from the master.

# Miscellaneous Notes

- The Receiver can be paired with CONNEX ProSight App for Mobile Streaming. (Yet to be Tested)

- The HDMI data cannot be streamed to laptops  as they don't have HDMI inputs. But we can use some HDMI capturing devices to  get the footage from the camera on to the Laptop (Really Expensive  Starting at $300)

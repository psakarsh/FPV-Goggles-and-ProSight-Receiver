# Introduction to ROS -- Self Study

---

- Use this document to help you study.
- For each item, make a list of questions that you have.  Identify all of the things that don't make sense to you.  Clearly denote these as questions.
- Also, make notes when you have answered a question.  Clearly denote these as things that you now understand.
- In the end, you should have no unanswered questions.

- This document is written in *markdown*.  It's a great language for documentation.  Here's a cheatsheet for you:  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

- You will be asked to turn in paper copies of your compiled document.  Please make sure it's neatly formatted.  I suggest using the 
`remarkable` software package that is already installed on your virtual machine.
